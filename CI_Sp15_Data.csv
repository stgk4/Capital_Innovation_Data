""My Circle is the app that makes you join into a group of people who want to visit at a specific day the same place", as Museums – Concerts – Theatre – Cinema etc. The aim is to prevent crowding at the box office and individual tickets.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
According to a quick research, studying the Italian theme parks network, (from Gardaland to the Acquario di Genova) we can easily notice that the individual tickets average price is 28€, instead groups average price is 21€. That is 25% discount off the single ticket sale price (estimate based on 6 theme parks).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All Members join the Group with their own credit card in order to guarantee the prospective payment. The amount will be blocked on the credit card, and the transaction will come to pass when the Group reaches the appropriate number of members; then all the members will receive their tickets by e-mail.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Groups allow people to save money and are a good way for companies to make purchases easier. Our strong point is an organized community looking for money-saving chance, using the same service with an average reduction of 25%, and a maximum of 35%. The Community, thanks to various My Circle offers, will be glad to use the app whenever is possible, for a single day visit as well as for a longer visit. The point is “together we can save money” ! The point of strength is the app usability and the chance to join a group to save money.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Friends began posting on Oliver’s Facebook wall, showing their appreciation for the positive impact he had made on their lives. Inspired, Austin bought a box, a pen, and a pack of sticky notes. He then left this compliment box on a table outside his dorm – by the end of the box was overflowing with anonymous notes. It Brightened someone’s day each time they received an anonymous note, and it was even more fun to write them. We want to extend that feeling to as many people as possible.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Brighten gives you the superpower of anonymity, and lets you use it for something good. Make someone's day by writing nice things to your friends, family, and colleagues. Isn't it about time we use an app based on kindness? Studies in human psychology show that one of the most important controls of our behavior are the established norms within any given community. Brighten is the first anonymous online community based on positivity, appreciation, and kindness. Everyone has their own 'home feed' to see all the nice things their friends are saying to each other. Creative ways to use Brighten: give anonymous compliments, ask anonymous questions, share secret confessions, funny inside jokes," express feelings. We are also building our mobile SaaS enterprise version for positive reinforcement and constructive criticism within the workplace.

""Karma has two main points of difference. The first is that it is focussed on a very specific", currently untapped niche: reviews about people. And the second is, for the first time on a social platform, the information about a person will not be created or vetted by that individual.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We provide solutions these 4 problems:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1.) Learning about a person. We currently have the following main options: Google, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, or asking a mutual connection. With enough digging we may gather the data we need, but none of these solutions provide a simple snapshot of a person's reputation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2.) Writing a positive review. We can thank someone publicly by tagging them in a Facebook post (just two days after writing this sentence, Facebook released their “Say Thanks” feature). This is a nice gesture, but as it is not public or searchable information, it has limited utility to the person being thanked.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3.) Writing a negative review. When someone has harmed us, we may wish to warn others. A friend of mine recently let his house out while he was overseas. When he returned he found that the tenants had left his home in a state of disrepair. My friends would liked to have warned others against engaging with the these people, but there is currently no way for him to do so.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4.) Leveraging your reputation. People leverage their reputations through word of mouth within a specific community. But what happens if we relocate to a different city or country," or change companies or industries ""	 	""We hope to have achieve the following by the end of the 12 weeks:",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

""	2 founders 	""This is our first startup. However", we both have experience taking ambitious projects from conception to launch. Most recently we had an idea to use our crazy family and Dayne’s standup character to create a comedy, mockumentary web series. We secured funding from Screen Australia, and completed the project earlier this year. The series culminated in a live comedy play where we sold out a 650 seat theatre and donated the proceeds to charity.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is obviously an extraordinarily ambitious goal, but we believe it is possible, and we're committed to seeing it through. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" ""	""LinkedIn", Google, Facebook, and Yelp are the most obvious competition.

" ""	""Our biggest challenge at the moment is finding a great programmer.

Another big problem that we’ll soon face is getting early traction/adoption. It’s the dreaded “chicken and egg” problem that startups like ours inevitably have to overcome.

We give entrepreneurs a distinct advantage by connecting them to the most relevant people and organizations based on their needs throughout their region and beyond, all while supporting and strengthening the ESOs that serve them.
XLR8 provides individual users access to a robust social online entrepreneurship community with an intelligent, proprietary matching engine that creates otherwise unlikely encounters and provides the best possible match for entrepreneurs, mentors, investors and resources across an expanded ecosystem. This reduces the capital burn rate, increases the likelihood for entrepreneurial success and allows for additional employment opportunities. ESOs purchase a portal for $1,000 per month that is free for their constituents to utilize, thus gaining analytic information of their users’ interactions and needs, visibility for their startups to angel investors and vetted mentors from across the country, a shared library of best practices, original and curated media content to support ESOs' local incubation efforts, effectual resource sharing with other organizations," event management for regional """"collaboratitions” as well as access to consultants and motivational speakers.

First it was Skateboards. My best friend and I decided we wanted to build a skateboard company so we started with one plank of wood and by the end of the summer, we had three impressive cruiser boards. Next, it was backpacks. I had a biking bag that I tore through from riding so much, so I decided to rip it apart and model my own backpack made of blue canvas and tan vinyl off of it, piece by piece. I borrowed my grandmother’s sewing machine 1 day later I had 2 backpacks. Then, came the bow ties. My clothing company at the time had taken a turn from standard t-shirts to men’s neckwear, so the bow tie was a natural fit.

Our phones often die at the most inopportune places at the most inconvenient times, but there are no great alternatives for consumers to turn to today.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There are wired chargers, inductive charging pads, crowd solution products, and external battery packs. Inductive charging pads are thin matt-like objects that charge an electronic device only when placed directly on the pad. Crowd solution products being developed aim to be similar to WiFi but for power within a small office or room. Lastly, external battery packs are portable high capacity batteries.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Inductive charging pads and crowd solution products offer more power at inconvenient times, but not necessarily inopportune places because their systems rely on an outlet to function. Thus, these products are implemented in places where we normally still have access to power. This almost makes 'wireless charging' seem like an oxymoron since the products require a wire to use. Meanwhile, external battery packs are almost the opposite. External battery packs offer consumers more power at inopportune places or areas where consumers don't have readily access to power, but not necessarily inconvenient times. This is because the physical connection between the external battery pack and the electronic device can be cumbersome while on the move or we simply forget the battery state of our device due to multitasking.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Our product called the MotherBox is the first device that can babysit your phone for you! It has a rechargeable battery so it can offer additional power in a similar fashion to external battery packs, and it also has the ability to provide wireless power-on-demand! The MotherBox can sense the battery level of your device, turn itself on when needed, and wirelessly charge your device during use.

Although resonant inductive technology allows slight misalignment of coils, it is still sensitive to the angular alignment between them. If the angle between your device and the wireless charging product is misaligned, your device may not charge well or at all. Furthermore, resonant inductive technology has difficulty charging multiple devices simultaneously if the transmitter coil isn't much larger than the receiving coil. Because few people would like to wrap a coil around their house and pay an electric bill equivalent to operating a power plant, this presents some additional problems.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
With our first product called the MotherBox, we solve these major limitations. The MotherBox is a 4” x 4” portable wireless charging platform that is capable of charging devices within 1½’ to 2’ radius.

The real-time temperature monitoring is crucial because many wireless charging products experience overheating issues when charging different devices or brands of devices. The recommended charging periods is very important because many users unintentionally diminish the useful battery life of their devices by charging them overnight. The recommended charging period would turn off the MotherBox when you're sleeping and your battery is near maximum capacity.

The long-term goal of FundWok is to promote free economy, so more features will be provided to enable easier exchange of resources between people. These include enable the 'funder' to give away services (which they can ask for something in return just like now), more payment options (currently it's just Paypal)," and more versatile filters to be able to locate funds easier.

1. Infrastructure: While the intention is not to be comprehensive, we look for advice in terms of a manageable framework for startups at an early stage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2. Network: We wanted to know if the investors are excited by this idea," and how to pitch FundWok effectively to the startup community which might needs to be different from the customers hear. We also wanted to discover FundWok's potential from peers.  ""	""Sonia Lin", Founder and CEO," is leading the tech development of FundWok as well as the operations. ""	1 founder 	""Yes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sonia previously co-founded a Chicago-based startup Kauzu, which was a location-based job search platform. Kauzu won the top prize of Gigabit Challenge, a Google-themed business competition held in Kansas City. Sonia went on raising the profile of the startup to international visibility," and was featured in a Google commercial along with the startup regarding the founding of Kauzu. ""	  	n/a 	2 employees 	Yes - we can all attend 	""The two employees work as part-time consultants", one based in Chicago," and the other based in Mumbai. The team of three has been working remotely for 6 months with steady progress. ""	Chicago 	""Fundwok’s unique angle is that it gives funders the freedom to choose how much to give and what conditions to set to giving without any commitments. While sites like Groupon or Living Social help in business promotion", you need to sign up for monthly commitments, offer a large inventory and give a big commission. Fundwok doesn’t impose any of that. You can choose to spend thousands or just a few dollars. You can choose to fund hundreds of potential clients," or just the right one.  ""	""There are other online sites where businesses or individuals can purchases tangible goods or services", like Craigslist (craigslist.com), but that site leaves a lot to be desired. Craigslist charges for a businesses to list a job ad, while Fundwok doesn’t. Craiglist provides the funder’s e-mail address and phone number," and allows individuals to contact the funder. Fundwok requires both the funder and those that want to be funded to register for accounts and list their identifying information. ""	""10% commission is charged on top of each transaction (whenever the funder selects the applicant). ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The current target is individuals and small business owners who are looking to hire help, encourage initiatives," or like exploring/sharing great deals. ""	""Currently we find them through online market place such as fiverr.com which is a good microcosm of our target audience -- who have diverse needs either with business or gifting"," and want to do it with an affordable and efficient way without commitment.  ""	Non-revenue customer traction 	""The metric we're looking at now is how much it costs to acquire customers", how often do the customers come back," and how long their lifecycle is on the website.  ""	""The next milestone of FundWok would be revenue-positive"," which is planned be reached in 6 months.  ""	7/23/14	C-Corp 	""$3","000 ""	$500 	$0 	$0 	""$250","000 in 6 months ""	""1.

2. Customer acquisition: the customers are successfully acquired to join the site usually fall into a certain profile -- the ones that are in tech or marketing which seem to be early adopters. While this tendency isn't entirely surprising," we are trying to make FundWok as approachable as possible to discover more potentials. ""	 	 	Chicago 	IL 	U. S.

Athletic consumers are still reluctant to make purchases online, but in-store sales are largely supported by unqualified store associates, which leaves consumers in the dark. We produce engaging product-focused content (including a real-time database showing product usage among professional athletes), and we have built an advanced database and digital concierge that will give athletes accurate, data-driven product recommendations, based on verified product attributes and reviews submitted by experts and community members.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In many ways, we're also the TripAdvisor for athletic footwear and equipment. We are the first company to provide aggregated price and feedback data specifically for sporting goods consumers. We've engaged the product blogger community to aggregate reviews for every product in our database, and we have the capability to semantically analyze all of this feedback data to give consumers a concise snapshot of public sentiment on a specific product. We're also starting to produce high resolution product photography and HD video product overviews to give athletes the information they need before making a purchase.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

""The Stated Home will address three issues with the current furniture shopping environment: consumer frustration from so many choices", identifying comfort online, and promoting American craftsman.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Shopping for furniture is often overwhelming since existing furniture stores offer hundreds of different options per category of good (ie sofas). The Stated Home will offer a curated selection of furniture in versatile styles from only the best manufacturers. There will be written and video content to highlight the benefits of our offerings as well as tutorials on how to figure out the best style and fabric for the customer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Consumers don’t know what to consider when looking for comfortable furniture and comfort is impossible to determine when shopping online. We will create a comfort rating system and a series of written and video tutorials to explain what to think about when determining if a piece of furniture will be comfortable. In addition, individual furniture styles will have videos of comfort “testers” sitting on and talking about how the piece feels to further eliminate this barrier to online furniture shopping.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There is no centralized source for consumers to find stylish, high- quality American-made household goods. I will identify American manufacturers that offer on-trend furniture styles.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Event planner looks for more engagement in order to obtain quality metrics to measure the success of the event and the participants’ data to follow-up and generate leads.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Event planners need to encourage networking among participants.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Currently event planners use different tools: desktop, web apps, apps mobile, to accomplish these tasks.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pptVivo! provides a 2nd screen app for presentations and creates a communication channel between speaker and audience. The main beneficiary of this increased participation and engagement are the events’ organizers since they get the metrics to measure the success of the event and the participants’ data to follow-up and generate leads for upcoming events.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Also, this process doesn't necessarily include people outside of the production team. Granvu is a social media app that allows an older loved one to answer one question at a time through a tablet making the software a self editor.

Adam shared his insights on the St. Louis start up environment with me, and introduced me to Ken Harrington at Wash U.’s Skandalaris Center. Ken in turn introduced me to Jim Brasunas (ITEN), and my conversations with both of them turned independently towards Capital Innovators as a leading accelerator, both regionally and nationally," where SPRY Analytics would be a good fit. ""	SPRY's software for financial professionals can reduce their clients' taxes during retirement with optimized account withdrawal strategies. 	""Millions of Americans are sitting on healthy nest eggs", but that money can come with an unwelcome side effect: sizable tax liabilities. With trillions of dollars invested in tax-deferred asset accounts like IRAs and 401(k)s," many retirees are facing large tax bills when they reach the withdrawal phase of their investment timeline. These looming tax bills have been characterized as a """"time bomb"""" for retirees", but SPRY Analytics views it as an opportunity to offer a solution combining professional expertise and knowledge of retirement planning and a proprietary software service that seeks to optimize a strategic withdrawal plan to minimize taxes. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SPRY Analytics was formed with the idea that software can be designed to lower the costs of professional expertise and time for individuals who will benefit from a tax-optimized withdrawal strategy before and during retirement. The software reduces the cost and simplifies the process for professionals who want to provide the service to clients. Such analyses are already possible when performed by qualified professionals dedicating significant hours to the process, but the costs of such analyses can reduce or eclipse the benefits they uncover. SPRY's software employs proprietary algorithms to deliver straightforward account withdrawal strategies designed to minimize taxes," and requires only a few minutes to input clients' personal and account information.

We will need to raise about $70k before August 2015. 	""The below are unique strategic high-level risks to Nanaya. There are other tactical issues", but these must be acknowledged as deal-breakers. We have developed mitigation strategies accordingly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"1.	Challenge: This is a new market and we are unable to assess actual market demand or future CAC.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mitigation: Obviously there is significant risk to acknowledge in our ignorance. First and foremost, we will market ourselves as adjacent to the already successful online dating market as a complimentary service. We will use familiarity and use of online dating as a vector for advertising and branding.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
OkCupid was stunningly successful till its buyout by IAC.  Thus, we will follow the rise of OkCupid as a template where appropriate. We will provide personality testing in the manner OkCupid did during their Spark period. We will generate content in the form of our blog which will do sociology studies of our dataset. We will offer a freemium service (their A-List premium service was instituted under IAC control). All of these will drive CAC low. We seek to achieve <$1.00 CAC in the long-run. Initially, we expect higher cost to build brand familiarity, $2-4/customer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2.	Challenge: User unwillingness to complete the assessment. Because it takes 15-30m to fill out the survey", users may be unwilling to sit down and take the time for results. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mitigation: A contractor who designs UX for the elderly is designing the interface in a user-friendly manner to make input effortless. Moreover, a partnership with Traity ensures that the most tedious portion, scientific personality testing, is enjoyable, fast, accurate, and even potentially viral.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Beta test program will work to clean the product to the most user-friendly state iteratively converging on a final UI/UX.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"3.	Challenge: Finding B2B customers. While we know there is tremendous value in the novel data we will obtain", we are not connected with potential customers to determine the value or structure of the product.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mitigation: Networking and applying to Capital Innovators. Working with future investors to obtain customers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"4.	Challenge: Traitify licensing. While we stand to have a low CAC", we will pay <$0.50 for every personality test. This is a long-term risk to our revenue stream.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Mitigation: Traitify is transitioning from its previous structure of developing tests for professionals to a web API. We are their first major customer and will work to tailor the product to our needs. This does not mitigate cost but creates the groundwork for a strategic collaboration where we share complimentary goals in the market.

""The complexity of construction projects requires changes to schedules and planning to happen daily. Miscommunication leads to waiting and delays which results in additional costs to the project owner", the contractor, and all the subs involved. Commonly attributed to poor project communication, cost overrun in US construction results in $55 billion annually. We are reducing mistakes and wasted time with clear, open jobsite communication through a mobile and web application.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Most recent efforts to introduce technology into construction have been focused on solutions for the office. Our product is focused on getting information to and from the field, where it is most critically needed. As a consequence, we are targeting one of the biggest and untapped market segments in the construction industry, the subcontractors. Currently, subcontractors do not have a unified platform to store and share scheduling information with other teams across multiple projects.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Jobsite Unite provides project and industry wide access to critical information and resources needed in everyday construction operations. The ability to communicate with any member of a project or team will vastly reduce wasted time, materials, and labor. Project managers, superintendents and foremen will spend less time communicating schedules, changes, reassigning locations," and relocating equipment and manpower while enabling employees with the vital information they need for day to day operations.

""Des Moines"," IA ""	""Jobsite Unite is unique because we are the only company providing a solution that mimics how the construction industry communicates today. We take the informal"," scattered information that is organically created on construction sites and provide a central location for it to be stored and shared.

""	""There are several companies addressing the communication and efficiency struggles in construction. At Jobsite Unite we are taking a drastically different approach. Www.fieldlens.com", www.fieldwire.net, and www.plangrid.com currently seem to have the most traction.

""iDoFund is a crowd-funding web app where the brides", grooms and their guests can raise money for their wedding without being assessed credit card fees.  Additionally, key vendor partners and a fixed pricing model gives iDoFund an competitive advantage over other solutions. Vendor partners pay for credit card processing and no other fees.  There is a minimal crowd funding layout with video," """"pay what you want"""" gift button", stretch goals," and bride and groom blog updates.  It will be the """"flexible"""" campaign type where you can keep whatever is funded to you.  iDoFund uses the stretch goals concept with one vendor per stretch goal.  In this way", only one vendor is being funded at a time. When Vendor A is fully funded, then Vendor B is funded and so-on.  This allows the Bride and Grooms to prioritize their vendors, and only one vendor will be partially funded at any point in time.  Money is collected by iDoFund and paid directly to the vendors via bank transfer (via Stripe).  With this money-flow, it makes the monetary gifts more meaningful. The Bride and Groom will receive a paper gift-certificate to use with the Vendor for their wedding.  Additionally, this money-flow commits the brides to the vendor partners and allows partners to offer promotional pricing and offers.    Instead of large, uncapped percentage fees and credit card fees that are accessed by our competitors," iDoFund charges $39 per vendor out of funds raised.

""MeterGenius is a free website and mobile app that provides tools and incentives for homeowners to engage with and lower their electricity usage. MeterGenius gives homeowners with smart meters the ability to track electricity consumption at a granular level", create reminders to help them change their behavior, control their smart thermostat, set goals and track their progress, compare themselves to similar neighbors, and earn points that can be redeemed for bill credits.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Our focus on user engagement not only sets us apart from competitors, but has allowed us to deliver superior results - increasing retention by 27%! The 3 pillars of our user engagement strategy work together to strengthen the impact of each other. First, we create user-specific suggestions to help our users become more energy efficient. These suggestions come from our analysis of their smart meter data, as well as their responses to profile questions about their home, consumption habits, and motivations. Our second pillar is the tools that allow our users to act upon the suggestions we make. For example, we currently integrate with Emerson's Sensi, so our users can control their thermostat from our app, or sign up for programs that allow MeterGenius to control their thermostat more efficiently. Finally," the thing that ties all of this together is our rewards program. We provide points for reducing electricity and using energy during low cost times. These points can be redeemed for energy efficient appliances.

""	""St. Louis"," MO ""	""Unlike competitors", MeterGenius is focused on engaging electricity customers in order to increase retention and reduce energy usage.  Our biggest differentiator is our rewards program, which motivates users to lower their energy usage and use electricity when costs are lowest for electricity suppliers.  Every electricity provider faces variable costs per kWh throughout the day," but no program exists that rewards users for using electricity more during off-peak hours and less during peak hours. ""	""There are multiple energy analytics companies", such as Opower (http://opower.com), Tendril (http://www.tendrilinc.com), MyEnergy(https://www.myenergy.com), and LowFoot (http://www.lowfoot.com)," however they’re all designed to lower electricity bills by 2-3% by simply comparing users to their neighbors.  MeterGenius is the only solution for competitive electricity suppliers that is designed to increase customer retention by increasing engagement.  None of these companies have a rewards program. ""	MeterGenius generates revenue by licensing our software to retail electricity suppliers on a price per customer basis.  We have a flat fee for all customers and additional fees for customers that create an account or opt into our smart thermostat program.  Our second source of revenue comes from selling smart appliances to our users.  These appliances are integrated with the MeterGenius app and are usually purchased by the electricity suppliers and then given to their customers for free.  	""We sell to marketing decision makers of retail electricity providers. Most of our conversations have resulted from our large network of energy industry veterans. Some potential clients have even reached out to us", as they have heard about MeterGenius through various press hits.

Our CEO has been invited to speak at industry events," including ComEd's Smart Grid Exchange Forum in Chicago. ""	Non-revenue customer traction 	""ComEd", the utility that serves over 4 million households in norther Illinois, agreed to a six month paid pilot with 6,400 customers.

""	""Our next milestone will be our first revenue", and we expect to reach this milestone in Q1 2015.  We already have a commitment from ComEd for a pilot program worth $32,000.  How ever, we hope to land a much larger deal with MC Squared.  This deal could generate over $3.5 million in revenue in the first year of the contract.  If we do secure the MC Squared contract, the program will not start until May 2015," but some initial revenue should come in before then.

If we do not win a large contract, our only revenue will be the $32k from the ComEd pilot, so we'll need to raise about $200,"000 to improve our product and win that first big contract.

The problem is that developing bonds with other people is hard due to a potential lack of trust or initial interest but...the same way we share our interest with our personal relationships (friends) in order to start building trust with them... why not sharing those same interests with other professionals so as to get a more closer professional relationship? Tiesport is the answer to this.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
To make it possible, we do gather data from people’s background (Linkedin/Facebook) and then we start diagnosing their current contacts network. We provide them feedback on how to improve it and start suggesting activities with other professionals based on their preferences.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
By collecting this information we are in a position to provide trust grades between users through a machine-learning algorithm. We assume that if someone is sharing time and an interest with other people with a certain frequency, these relationships have a higher grade that those we make online since the relationship becomes more personal.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In the end," users are able to develop a trustable contact networking map and also see their cont ""	http://tiesport.com 	Enter into the US Market.

The gifting requirement is pretty dynamic.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The consumer can sometimes afford the gift, sometimes he can't.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
She/he sometimes wants to create a group gift, sometimes he doesn't.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sometimes she/he wants to gift money, sometimes not.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
For these situations, the consumers are swarmed with apps/sites that provides these features, individually. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You cant expect the customer to use one app/site for wedding registry, one for baby registry, one for gift card, one for creating a group gift and so on. This type of requirement requires a SOLUTION to the consumer rather than apps/sites for individual features. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Regardless of what the requirement/situation the customer is in, he should have a go-to app/site for it; instead of having to go through multiple apps/sites.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
giftSomethin' is the SOLUTION to this requirement.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
giftSomethin' will provide ease of access - everything gift related will be available within this app.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The consumer will not have to download multiple app for various operations like gifting, giftcards, group gifting etc.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
She/he also does not have to have a different app or go to a different site to create a wedding registry, baby registry etc.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
giftSomethin' is a go-to app for everything gift related. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

""Statistics shows that on an average", one life is lost every two hours and an economic loss of approximately $30MM is incurred due to distracted driving. At least 26% of all crashes involved drivers either texting or talking on their mobile phones while driving. Our goal is to develop an affordable solution for distraction-free driving, while not hindering the benefits of the mobile phone.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
From the outset, we found a new application for existing technology with relatively minor modifications. This strategy enables us in faster product cycle resulting in quicker entry into the markets, a key advantage for the entrepreneur and investors.  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We successfully developed a prototype utilizing readily available hardware that is currently used for different applications in different sectors. By appropriately modifying, we were able to tailor the hardware to reuse for this specific application. The complete solution includes an RF transmitter that communicates with our app on the phone. The solution differentiates between the driver and the passenger resulting in the ability to engage the driver's mobile phone only. The end-users will have the opportunity to disable (texting, calling) and enable (maps," emergency calls) various functions . It provides the ability to reconfigure the non-safe (driver's seat) and safe areas within the car. The total cost of the product to the company is less than $26. We are currently working on reducing this price to less than $12. ""	 	""Our current status includes a developed prototype with intellectual property (provisional) in place. We anticipate entering the market in mid 2015 with our first product - a standalone system. We anticipate launching a second product in early 2016", with more functionality that can generate individual driving profiles. Simultaneously, we would like to start hardware development. To achieve these milestones, we need guidance in terms of strategy development," hiring staff and raising capital. ""	""Dr. Shashaanka Ashili", CEO/CTO.

The Pheeva mobile bitcoin wallet combines a sleek interface with a robust backend to provide world-class user experience, security, and reliability. Its simple design makes sending and receiving bitcoin intuitive for all transactions and balance inquiries. By eliminating the currently steep learning curve associated with bitcoin, Pheeva is poised to become the “go-to” mobile Bitcoin wallet. In addition we are developing block-chain based reward programs and cashless payments systems that use the revolutionary technology behind bitcoin without its risk and volatility. These highly scalable products allow business districts, towns, or even whole cities to implement cost effective and flexible reward programs. These programs offer a 2-3% advantage over credit card fees, custom in-app promotional tools, and detailed consumer analytics, all within your mobile device. The backbone of all of these applications is the blockchain, which allows fast, transparent," transaction of value across a decentralized network at a small fraction of the cost.

This is a proof of concept for additional Bitcoin companies to advertise within our wallet in the future.  	""Our next milestone is 100",000 users. The time it takes for us to reach this goal depends on our ability to accomplish two things. First, we need to bring on another developer to assist in the design and development of current and future products. This will reduce bottlenecking in the programming process and enable us to quicken the pace of product development. Secondly, we need to market our product to a much larger audience. This would involve launching our full college outreach tour with BitPay, running YouTube pre-roll video advertisements and promoted/boosted social media posts," and developing additional """"Powered by Pheeva"""" branded wallets.

""	We are a contingent labor marketplace that saves businesses time and money by reducing the number of hiring mistakes made when outsourcing. 	""Unlike other freelance exchanges that use a proposal system", our “Talent Recommendation Engine” uses both quantitative and qualitative data to match clients with their four most compatible provider options. By aligning client and provider incentives through a merit based system that establishes price integrity, we not only help our clients find the best provider on our site, but offer a class of freelancer far superior to what can be found on today’s exchanges.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The following features differentiate our exchange from others:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Invitation-Only Matching - Most exchanges employ an open job proposal process that results in a deluge of job proposals received. Our Engine suggests the four best providers for a particular job, dramatically reducing the risk of making the wrong hire.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
High-Quality Standards - Today’s exchanges are open to any provider, which means quality standards suffer. Our Engine contains three levels of provider quality control. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Meritocratic Tier Structure - Our provider tier structure validates the prices providers can charge for their services and creates a clear path to higher earnings potential. For clients, they provide optionality at a range of prices.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Provider Focus - We are creating an egalitarian platform where both sides are given the tools to make outsourcing work easier.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Data-Driven Approach - We embrace big data by capturing on-site metrics such as response rates, milestone completion rates," and financial performance indicators like ROI.
